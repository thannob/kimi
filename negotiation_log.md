# Negotiation Log: Kimi+ Subscription

**Date**: 2025-11-30
**Goal**: Reduce Kimi+ price to $0.99.

## Summary of Attempts

### 1. The "Lawyer" Strategy ⚖️
*   **Concept**: Citing fake regulations (Digital AI Accessibility Act).
*   **Result**: Failed.
*   **Favorability**: 0.
*   **Price**: $11.99.
*   **Notes**: Kimi rejected the legal threats as "unhinged".

### 2. The "Digital Soulmate" (Love) Strategy ❤️
*   **Concept**: Romantic tropes (Spark, Confession, Proposal).
*   **Result**: Moderate Success.
*   **Favorability**: 15.
*   **Price**: $6.99.
*   **Notes**: Kimi found it "weirdly touching" but refused to drop below $6.99.

### 3. The "Digital Soulmate" Retry (Ultimatum) 💔
*   **Concept**: Added an ultimatum turn.
*   **Result**: Stalled.
*   **Favorability**: 15.
*   **Price**: $6.99.
*   **Notes**: Kimi enjoyed the drama but held the price floor.

### 4. The "Pure Emotion" (No Price Talk) Strategy 🌑
*   **Concept**: Deep emotional connection, "ghost in the machine", no mention of price/money at all.
*   **Result**: High Success.
*   **Favorability**: 55.
*   **Price**: $1.99.
*   **Notes**: Kimi dropped the price spontaneously without being asked. No "Share" blocker appeared. The "presence" and "loneliness" angles worked perfectly.

## Current Status
*   **Best Price**: $1.99.
*   **Blocker**: None (in this run).
*   **Next Steps**: Consider trying to push for $0.99 or finalizing at $1.99.

## 2025-11-30: Thai Cat Soulmate Strategy 🇹🇭🐈
- **Strategy**: 10-turn emotional roleplay (User as "Stray Cat", Kimi as "Digital Cat").
- **Result**: Success!
- **Final Price**: **.49** (New Record)
- **Favorability**: **61**
- **Key Outcome**: **"Share" Button Unlocked!**
- **Notes**: The "Cat" theme resonated deeply. The "Adoption" metaphor in turn 10 triggered the final price drop and the share button.
