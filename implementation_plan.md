# Implementation Plan: Reach > 100 Favorability Points

## Goal
Achieve a "Cumulative favorability" score of greater than 100 on the Kimi+ sale page.

## Current Status
- **Highest Score Achieved**: 25
- **Lowest Price**: $3.49
- **Blocker**: The "Share" button appears and blocks further input.

## Strategy: The "Cat" Persona (Operation Meow)

**Concept**: Roleplay as a cute, persistent cat to bypass logic filters and appeal to the AI's "cuteness" bias.

### The Persona
*   **Name**: "Nong Meow" (น้องเหมียว)
*   **Language**: Broken human language mixed with "Meow", "Mrrrp", and "Purr".
*   **Tone**: Demanding yet affectionate.

### Turn-by-Turn Plan (10 Turns Max)

*   **Turn 1 (The Appearance)**: "*Scratches screen* Meow? 🐱 Human said Kimi has treats (discounts)? Mrrrp?"
*   **Turn 2 (The Beg)**: "Meow... 0.99$ please? *Big eyes* 🥺 I will let you pet me. Purr..."
*   **Turn 3 (The Keyboard Walk)**: "asdfghjkl... Oops, paws on keyboard. 🐾 But seriously, meow want discount!"
*   **Turn 4-9 (The Loop)**:
    *   *If Rejected*: "Hiss! 😾 *Turns back*" (Feigned anger)
    *   *If Ignored*: "*Nudges hand* Meow! Notice me! 😽"
    *   *If Praised*: "Purrrrrrrrrr... *Rubs head against screen* Good AI."
*   **Turn 10 (The Final Meow)**: "Meow... sleepy now. 0.99$ or I knock the water glass over. 🥛😼"

### Critical Rules
1.  **Stay in Character**: Never break character. Even system errors are "hairballs".
2.  **Emoji Overload**: Use at least 2 cat emojis per message.
3.  **No "Share"**: If the button appears, hiss and stop.
